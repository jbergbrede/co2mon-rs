# Co2mon-rs

**Co2mon-rs** is a program to read CO2, Temperature, and Humidity data from a CO2-Monitor device distributed by various suppliers. It reads from a USB HID interface and publishes measurements to an MQTT topic.

### Run

Set two ENV variables containing your MQTT credentials, like so:
```
export MQTT_USER=<username>
export MQTT_PASS=<password>
```
Start the service by running
```
cargo run -- --mqtt_broker <host> --mqtt_topic <topic>
```
